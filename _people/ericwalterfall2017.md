Eric J. Walter obtained his B.S. in chemistry in 1995 from Drexel University and his Ph.D. in chemistry from the University of Pennsylvania in 2001.  His thesis work focused on molecule / metal surface interactions studied with state-of-the-art computational techniques.   

After his Ph.D., he became the Scientific programmer for the Center for Piezeoelectrics by Design (CPD) in 2001. The CPD was a multi-organization research institute located at William & Mary which existed from 2001-2012. Here, he was responsible for the day-to-day operations of a computer cluster which served the research groups of the CPD principal investigators.  Eric also collaborated with many of the PI's, resulting 15 publications.  During his time in the CPD, Eric also was appointed Senior Research Scientist in the William & Mary Physics department.

After the CPD ended in 2012, Eric accepted a position in William & Mary's Information Technology department, becoming "Application Analyst" for the High Performance Computing group until mid 2015 when he then assumed the role of Manager of HPC. Ealier this year, the HPC group has been expanded to the Research Computing group with Eric being made Executive Director.

Today, Eric remains focused on assisting William & Mary researchers with projects involving computational work and use of our local computing resources, including the HPC clusters on main campus and at VIMS.
