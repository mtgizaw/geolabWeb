I am an assistant professor of [Data Science](https://ds.wm.edu) and [Applied Science](https://as.wm.edu) at [William & Mary](https://www.wm.edu), currently working at the nexus of deep learning and satellite imagery analysis. I work with federal agencies and international NGOs to develop new and secure ways to measure, predict, and improve human wellbeing at micro to macro scales. In collaboration with my wonderful students in the [geoLab](https://geolab.wm.edu), I also help to provision [critical baseline data](https://www.geoboundaries.org) to the opensource community to improve data equality around the world.

Things that I spend my time on today include:
- Supporting my undergraduate and Ph.D. students' research through the [ICSS](https://icss.wm.edu) and [geolab](https://geolab.wm.edu).
- Coding for the [geoBoundaries Open Administrative Boundaries dataset](https://www.geoboundaries.org)  
- [Publishing](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lqrZ5MoAAAAJ&hl=en) some good ideas, burning cycles on bad ones.
- A range of projects exploring how novel neural network architectures can aid us in extracting data from satellites.  I.e., "playing with fancy videocards".
- Forgetting to update [my CV](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rdIEx_osvmdzQhukGPZ2FkaA_gLcRnrIfeY6fbkLJ7g/edit?usp=sharing)

If you are reading this page, please note that **I am always looking for good Ph.D. students!**  Good at Python, interested in computer vision and satellite data?  Like Williamsburg when you came as an elementary school student?  [Email me!](mailto:danr@wm.edu)
