All members of the geoLab, Emily Maison ’21, Joshua Panganiban ’20, Tina Chen ’22, and Laura Mills ’22 interned for the Global Environment Facility, where they independently collected and analyzed geospatial data.</p>

<p>The Global Environment Facility, commonly referred to as the GEF, is an organization that tackles pressing environmental issues and supports community-based and national sustainable development initiatives. In past years, students from the geoLab have worked with the GEF and have co-authored research papers for the organization.</p>

<p>“Moving towards the spring, the GEF offered more opportunities for conducting impactful international research,” Panganiban said. “And that led to the proposal of having four virtual internships related to the environment and GEF mission.”</p>

<p>Beginning in June, Maison, Panganiban, Chen, and Mills researched their four different projects for 40 hours a week. Though under the guidance of GEF, each student was required to pace and manage themselves, only meeting with GEF leadership once per week.</p>

<p>Maison–a recent graduate of the college–worked as the Assistant Program Manager for the geoParsing team’s BRIGHT project. For her summer research project, she worked on a literature review regarding the consequences of human encroachment on natural resources and how these unnatural conditions will lead to more infectious disease outbreaks.</p>

<p>“I applied to GEF to research COVID-19 because the semester before I did labor market research on the implications of COVID on health care access,” Maison said. “I wanted to take a different approach and further my understanding of the pandemic, and I think my work this summer did that. I loved doing the internship. It was enjoyable to lead my own research, as well as meet other people across different teams in the lab.”</p>

<p>Maison believes the knowledge she gained during this internship helped her improve her research on the geoLab’s BRIGHT project.</p>

<p>“I learned a lot about sustainable development goals from the UN, as well as the implications of different environmental interventions,” Maison said. “My research definitely helped me expand my knowledge on sustainability, as well as what contracting for another organization looks like.”</p>

<p>Mills currently works as an analyst for the geoData team and says she was excited to have an internship that revolved around the impacts of COVID-19. Her research utilized satellite imagery and forest change remote sensing data to study the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on land degradation and biodiversity.</p>

<p>“I looked at areas specifically within the Democratic Republic of Congo. Along with Brazil and Indonesia, the DRC was a top country in the world for deforestation as of March 2020,” Mills said. “As countries began focusing on lockdown restrictions at the start of COVID, deforestation occurred with decreased regulation. So even as people stay inside, protected areas are at risk of illegal mining and forest clearing.”</p>

<p>In order for Mills to track the high levels of deforestation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), she learned JavaScript and time series modeling in R over the summer. Prior, Mills had only ever coded in Python.</p>

<p>“It completely changed the way that I worked as a data scientist, and it made me so much more comfortable for classes and other geoLab projects this year,” Mills said. “My experience was just something I feel I would never get in a class.”</p>

<p>Chen is currently on the geoDev team, where she primarily works on the roadRunner project. Her study aimed to quantify the association between GEF interventions and local health conditions of children under five years in Kenya. Chen’s health measures included looking at rates of diarrhea and lower respiratory problems.</p>

<p>“We use the Health Survey data as well as the GPS data,” Chen said. “Then, I put them into a spatial statistical model called QGI, which was developed by Dr. Dan Runfola. And, through that model, we were able to tell the magnitude of the association and also how far away the impact could be. So in the end, we were able to make some recommendations to GEF to help them understand how their projects can impact not only the direct metrics, like the biodiversity or vegetations, but also the socio-economic and health aspect of their projects.”</p>

<p>Chen says she enjoyed being able to use the material she learned in her statistics classes and apply it to real-world problems.</p>

<p>“I learned a lot along the way,” Chen said. “Because in stats classes, you’re just looking at toy models, but in the real world models, there could be a lot of unexpected things happening there. I’m happy to see I’m involved in a project that could have some real-world impact.”</p>

<p>Panganiban, who graduated last Spring, was the former team lead for geoBoundaries but is now working as an accountant at Deloitte. His research analyzed satellite imagery and ancillary data to evaluate the impact of the GEF’s biodiversity projects in the Philippines for the past decades.</p>

<p>Panganiban collected data on the area’s biodiversity by using two metrics: a vegetation index that measured terrestrial biodiversity and fishing catch rates.</p>

<p>“If an area is increasing in fish catch, that means that factors supporting fish are increasing, such as productivity, algae growth, and high amounts of food. If the fish catch is high, then the ecosystem is probably pretty healthy,” Panganiban said. “This was only an analysis based on available data, which is why the interviews with executing agency officials were conducted to verify whether what we’re studying from satellites verifies what’s on the ground. That was the most interesting part.”</p>

<p>Panganiban conducted interviews with Filipino government officials in order to further his collection of data and monitor local sites. With the nation in lockdown, all the interviews were conducted virtually.</p>

<p>“One of the coolest things that I think I ever got to do was hop on Zoom calls and talk with officials from the Department of Environmental Natural Resources and seniors in NGO from different islands who are working remotely,” Panganiban said. “I was pretty much doing the same thing that someone in the Philippines would do, except I’m in the United States.”</p>

<p>In October, each student presented their research over Zoom to members of GEF and the head of the geoLab, Assistant Professor of Applied Science Dan Runfola. Much of the data they collected will be used in GEF’s future reports and papers.</p>

<p>“I think the most important part of that meeting, for me, was talking with people at the GEF about how our findings can impact future studies,” Mills said. “For example, I detected land degradation in one of the protected areas I analyzed. So, I explained that I thought it made sense to go in and do further on-the-ground evaluation to distinguish between seasonal land change versus something more abrupt like deforestation. And they agreed with that. We looked at satellite imagery and saw visual proof of potential deforestation.”</p>

<p>For the upcoming year, Maison, Mills, and Chen hope to use their acquired research skills and collected data to aid with future geoLab projects. All four students praised the geoLab for providing this opportunity, and Chen noted how appreciative she was to have a virtual internship for the summer when she originally expected to be unemployed.</p>

<p>“I think one important thing to note about the geoLab is that if you’re a passionate student, it will always find an opportunity for you,” Panganiban said. “Giving students the opportunity to see their work be used by a large international organization is truly the best gift we can offer.”</p>]]></content><author><name>Lulu Dawes</name></author><category term="Sustainability" /><category term="undergraduate-research" /><category term="public-summary" /><category term="ciep" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Studying health outcomes related to environmental interventions.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">geoLab: 2020 Annual Report</title><link href="https://geolab.wm.edu/vibrancy/sustainability/security/geoLabAnnualReport2020/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="geoLab: 2020 Annual Report" /><published>2020-12-31T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-12-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://geolab.wm.edu/vibrancy/sustainability/security/geoLabAnnualReport2020</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://geolab.wm.edu/vibrancy/sustainability/security/geoLabAnnualReport2020/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name>Dan Runfola</name></author><category term="Vibrancy" /><category term="Sustainability" /><category term="Security" /><category term="history" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our annual report for the year 2020.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Caroline Morin explores research passion through geoParsing, publishes papers on Chinese development financing</title><link href="https://geolab.wm.edu/news/geoparsingChineseDevelopmentMorin/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Caroline Morin explores research passion through geoParsing, publishes papers on Chinese development financing" /><published>2020-10-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-10-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://geolab.wm.edu/news/geoParsingChineseDevelopment</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://geolab.wm.edu/news/geoparsingChineseDevelopmentMorin/"><![CDATA[<p>During her free time in Vientiane, Laos, Caroline Morin ’22 often found herself motorbiking around the capital city’s special economic zones, where she was able to witness her research interest in person. No longer staring at Chinese development financing projects on her computer in Williamsburg, VA, Morin, who was working in Laos under the Freeman Intern Fellowship the summer after her freshman year, found herself even more drawn to the topic of Chinese international development.</p>

<p>“I would say living in Laos really changed everything,” Morin said. “On Sunday mornings, I would go see what the status of construction projects were. That’s just what I did for fun because Laos borders China. It was really transformational for my research being like…this is something I’m really interested in and finally being able to see it.”</p>

<p>Morin has been researching international aid since high school and took a gap year before her freshman year, where she was able to delve more into the topic. When she started at William and Mary, Morin became a research assistant at an on-campus lab that introduced her specifically to Chinese development financing. However, Morin wanted to search for more student-led research initiatives, which she found at the geoLab.</p>

<p>“I spent the summer exploring more topics on Chinese development financing because I was living in Southeast Asia,” Morin said. “And that’s how I met Matt Crittenden. And because he was also in Southeast Asia at the time (at the beginning of sophomore year), we sat down and chatted, and he told me all about the BRIGHT team and what they were doing. And I was like, ‘Oh, this is the exact topic I want to research but from a more student-driven perspective.’”</p>

<p>Matthew Crittenden ’21 is the team lead for geoParsing (one of the four student-led research teams in the geoLab) and introduced Morin to the Belt-Road Initiative Geospatial and Headline Tracking (BRIGHT) team. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a global infrastructure development plan by the Chinese government that invests in over 70 countries. The BRIGHT team uses satellite imagery to track Chinese development in Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>

<p>The BRIGHT team, which has seven members including Morin, is partnered with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), a combat support agency under the U.S. Department of Defense. Using NGA-funded commercial imagery, geoParsing is the first undergraduate team the agency has ever paired with. The NGA is also partnered with Columbia University’s international relations graduate program and multiple D.C. think tanks.</p>

<p>“Say we find a port in Cuba, and we read a lot of open-source information about what is happening in the port and what is being constructed,” Morin said. “We can look at the satellite imagery and say ‘OK, this information is wrong,’ or ‘this information is correct.’ Using satellite imagery is a way of going in-depth and holding open-source information accountable because a lot of times, the satellite imagery tells a very different story from what the news articles are publishing.”</p>

<p>Starting January 2020, Morin was tasked with writing the BRIGHT Team’s research on Bahamian ports in a paper, which would be published on the NGA’s platform named “The Tearline Articles.” Finishing the paper in the middle of June after writing approximately 4000 words, the NGA decided not to publish the piece, due to the specific ports falling into a “gray area” of the BRI.</p>

<p>Though Morin described the NGA’s choice as extremely disappointing, she says she and Crittenden were able to learn from the paper’s shortcomings and improve their research methods approach. Starting late June, Morin began writing the next two papers for the Tearline Articles, in which she worked hard to make sure the information was not in gray area and qualified as part of the BRI.</p>

<p>“We still wanted to talk about ports in the Caribbean because the BRI emphasizes transportation infrastructure, which, in the Caribbean, means ports,” Morin said.</p>

<p>The two papers Morin wrote in the latter half of the summer detailed the BRI’s work in seven Caribbean ports and energy infrastructure in Cuba. Due to U.S. sanctions in Cuba and the BRIGHT team’s mission to avoid any further gray areas, Morin recounted how “extremely complicated” the writing process was for the Tearline Articles. At the end of August, the NGA published Morin’s papers.</p>

<p>“It was very surreal….we were on the front page of intel.gov for over a month, which is so cool,” Morin said. “I think I had reached this place where I was like, ‘are they really ever going to get published?’ The hardest part about the papers after the expectations were set was the editing process. Because constantly you’re going back and editing and having to change things.”</p>

<p>For this upcoming semester, Morin is now the program manager of the BRIGHT team and is excited to implement many of her ideas to improve the team’s research process. The NGA recently approved this year’s project, which will involve the BRIGHT team looking into hydropower in South America. Morin hopes to carry out new methods that will improve efficiency and collaboration within the team.</p>

<p>“They’re such fantastic human beings,” Morin said, describing her team. “I think going into this semester, I came in with a lot of ideas and things I wanted to change about the lab. Our publications were phenomenal….But, just because of logistical difficulties, there was so much more time than I guess anyone expected, and Matt and I weren’t anticipating that we were going to work in the summer…but we did. It all worked out, but I want to change how the team interacts with each other.”</p>]]></content><author><name>Lulu Dawes</name></author><category term="Security" /><category term="student-leadership" /><category term="public-summary" /><category term="geoint" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multiple articles using high resolution satellite imagery to track Chinese activities.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Recently funded roadRunner project launches competition to build best convolution neural network</title><link href="https://geolab.wm.edu/news/roadrunnerintro/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Recently funded roadRunner project launches competition to build best convolution neural network" /><published>2020-09-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-09-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://geolab.wm.edu/news/roadRunner-bestCNN</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://geolab.wm.edu/news/roadrunnerintro/"><![CDATA[<p>When Jason Lin ’21 joined the Geospatial Evaluation and Observation Lab (geoLab) in the fall of 2019, the newly-created roadRunner project consisted of an uncompleted app and an idea to evaluate road quality from satellite imagery. Nearly a year later, the roadRunner project has transformed into one of the lab’s most promising ventures with over thirty college students across the state of Virginia competing to create the best convolution neural network (CNN) model.</p>

<p>The project began last year with Professor Peter Kemper and Eric Nubbe ’20, who were working to create an app that automatically evaluates road quality based on the smart phone’s built-in accelerometer. The pair began collaborating with the geoLab in hopes of it aiding with data collection. The project was passed to the geoDev team–one of four core teams in the lab–which began developing a CNN model that could come to rely solely on satellite imagery. The app was completed in the spring of 2020.</p>

<p>Lin, along with helping on the app, started working on building a CNN last spring, which uses artificial intelligence to analyze visual imagery. He believes that this technology could help indicate road quality in nations that struggle to routinely survey the roads.</p>

<p>“When we train this convolution neural network, the app is sort of helpful on its own, but having the neural network and being able to analyze real quality from satellite imagery…the implications of that are huge,” Lin said. “Within the US, we can definitely afford for people to evaluate roads. But in areas where it’s not feasible, like Honduras, the roads don’t really get analyzed that much. We don’t know which roads are good. But, you can point the satellite at it and say ‘what’s the road quality look like here?’ And [the CNN] will automatically determine: this road is terrible, I need to repair it.”</p>

<p>Currently overseeing the project with aid from project leader Lin is Ph.D. student Ethan Brewer, who is studying applied sciences at William and Mary. Brewer joined the roadRunner Project in June 2020, when he switched Ph.D. advisors to Dr. Dan Runfola (who runs the geoLab) after taking interest in Runfola’s work.</p>

<p>“[Runfola] handles the money side of things, and he has kind of an overall vision,” Brewer said. “He teaches me some things in that way. But in the end, I’m managing the whole project. I’m leading the project. I’m giving the team leaders directions….I sort of have a personal stake in it because I’m writing a chapter of my dissertation on the results of this project.”</p>

<p>Over the summer, the roadRunner Project received funding from the Commonwealth Cyber Initiative, a Virginia program that looks to support world-class research in data and cyber-physical systems. Through this funding, the project will sponsor 15 William and Mary students and 15 non-William and Mary students to come together in a year-long competition to develop a CNN model.</p>

<p>There will be six teams made up of students from different Virginian universities: William and Mary, Christopher Newport University, Virginia Tech, Virginia Commonwealth University, George Mason University, and the University of Richmond. Each team is made up of five members and has a William and Mary student as its leader.</p>

<p>Lin will serve as the team leader for the University of Richmond, while Brewer will be managing and overseeing the entire competition.</p>

<p>“We’ve sort of identified people from William and Mary who really have good, strong backgrounds in machine learning, data science, programming, and they are going to be the team leads,” Lin said. “So with these six teams, we’re going to be competing in a cattle competition. Our main focus is going to be improving the accuracy of the neural net when we look at satellite imagery”</p>

<p>The William and Mary students will receive a $1000 grant, and the non-William and Mary students will receive a $3000 grant. The $2000 discrepancy was supposed to cover travel costs, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the project will be conducted remotely for the fall semester.</p>

<p>“We have a total of basically 30 of the best computer science students in the state,” Brewer said. “I like working with the teams and seeing them evolve. I like teaching them. I like seeing their progress. I like seeing them learn.”</p>

<p>For the fall semester, the six teams will work to collect as much data as possible and integrate that information into a CNN model. Then, in the spring semester, each team will attempt to feed the other teams’ models bad data in the “data poisoning” phase.</p>

<p>“Data poisoning is where one team tries to feed bad data to the other teams’ models to see what effect it has on it,” Lin said. “Basically, one team tries to break the other teams’ models, and we want to make our own models resilient. One team is defending; one team is attacking. I want to make my model resilient against whatever you throw at it. I want to make it robust.”</p>

<p>The team that creates the overall best model by the end of the spring semester will be offered a guaranteed internship from the William and Mary Initiative for Computational Societal and Security Research (ICSS) for Summer 2021. Any student that makes an above-and-beyond contribution will be featured as a co-author of any relevant academic publication regarding the project.</p>

<p>“From the technical side of things, I mean, building the models is interesting, but I’m addressing the overall sort of can we do this type of thing?” Brewer said. “Because there are a lot of moving parts, and there are a lot of places where things can go wrong or where they can become difficult. So I’m sort of eager to see how things just work generally, whether the techniques that we’re using will actually lead to some accurate results.”</p>]]></content><author><name>Lulu Dawes</name></author><category term="Security" /><category term="student-leadership" /><category term="public-summary" /><category term="sdpp" /><category term="dl4sat" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Six-university collaboration on estimating road quality from space.]]></summary></entry></feed>
