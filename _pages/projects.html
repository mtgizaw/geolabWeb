The geolab seeks to <b>empower the disempowered</b> by <b>increasing the diversity</b> of those that can participate in data-driven decisionmaking.  We do this by <b>providing free access</b> to critical "building block" datasets and technologies, engaging in applied and basic research at the intersection between <b>artificial intelligence and big data,</b> and <b>training the next generation of leaders</b> in the use of data for decisionmaking activities.</p>
