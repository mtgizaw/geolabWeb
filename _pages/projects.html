We take on a wide range of applied and basic research projects at the intersection between <b>artificial intelligence, machine learning, and large-scale spatial data analysis</b>.  Each of our projects focuses on one of three core questions:

<summary><b>Vibrancy & Diversity</b></summary>
<p><i>How can we create and promote a vibrant society of data driven policymakers?</i></p>
<p>Projects in this area seek to <b>empower the disempowered</b> by <b>increasing the diversity</b> of those that can participate in data-driven decisionmaking.  We do this by <b>providing free access</b> to critical "building block" datasets and technologies, and <b>training the next generation of leaders</b> in the use of data for decisionmaking activities.</p>

<summary><b>Sustainability</b></summary>
<p><i>Are the actions we are taking to mitigate climate change working?</i></p>
<p>Projects in this area seek to <b>mitigate</b> negative human implications of a changing climate, focusing on the <b>identificaiton</b> of solutions that have worked - or, not - to date.  We do this by <b>developing new methodologies</b> which take advantage of freely available satellite imagery to monitor mitigation and adaptation strategies all across the globe.</p>

<summary><b>Security</b></summary>
<p><i>How are human livelihoods changing in some of the world's most inaccessible regions?</i></p>
<p>Projects in this area seek to <b>reduce</b> the likelihood that global citizens are put in harms way when operating in data-sparse, inaccessible regions. We do this by <b>collecting and publishing</b> event-based data on where country actors are conducting activities that may mediate security environments around the world, and <b>deriving new machine learning approaches</b> to remotely detect shifts in sentiment or human infrastructure of relevance to the global security environment.</p>
