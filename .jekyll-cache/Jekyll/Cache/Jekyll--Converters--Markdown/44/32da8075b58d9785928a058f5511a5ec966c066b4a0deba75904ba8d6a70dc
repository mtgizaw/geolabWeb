I".<p>Deep learning techniques have revolutionized a number of fields, predominantly based on research from the computer vision community.  The vast majority of literature on this topic has been focused around the use of portrait images - i.e., those taken from earthborne sensors.  Futher, the subset of literature engaged with satellite imagery has nearly entirely focused on scene classification - i.e., identifying if an image of a boat is, in fact, a boat when viewed from a satellite.</p>

<p>The <em>DL4SAT</em> project focuses on something different: improving our capability to extract continious, socioeconomic variables from satellite imagery using deep learning.  Itâ€™s built on the simple assumption that as human societies grow and change, so too does their impact on their local environment - from new roof types, to cars, to road infrastructure.</p>

<p>However, deep learning techniques to extract this type of information are exceptionally rare, and our basic understanding of the opportunities and limitations of these strategies of information retrieval is similarly lacking.  <em>DL4SAT</em> bridges this gap, testing and improving deep learning techniques in a range of contexts, from estimating income, to education, to road infrastructure - always focused on continious estimation of social factors.</p>
