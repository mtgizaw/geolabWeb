I"]<p>The geoInt project focuses on better understanding the evolution of international actors programs using high resolution satellite imagery.  Through qualitative analysis of time series pictures, students and staff working with the geoInt community will carefully annotate imagery to explore how on-the-ground conditions may have changed as a product of planned activities by groups from China, Russia, and related powers.  From ports to sustainable power projects, findings help to inform us as to the reality of projects on-the-ground: their environmental footprints, and the success or failure of projects.  This satellite information is used in conjunction with other sources (i.e., open source news media) to help tell previously untold stories about the ways in which global actors are impacting local conditions in geopolitically important regions.</p>
