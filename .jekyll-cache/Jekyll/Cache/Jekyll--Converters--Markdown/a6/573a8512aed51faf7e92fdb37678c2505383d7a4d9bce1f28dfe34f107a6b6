I"<p>The geoFellows program has three core goals, focused on increasing the diversity of leaders in the computational sciences:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Increase the number of minorities - especially females - engaged in computational research related topics.</li>
  <li>Engage with students enrolled in fields of study that do not usually overlap with computational research - i.e., History, Art, or Dance.</li>
  <li>Promote effective leadership in the context of real-world projects.</li>
</ol>

<p>Each academic year, a competitively selected group of students from universities all across the Commonwealth of Virginia are selected to become a geoFellow, and individual Fellows are assigned into leadership roles within a project that matches their interests.  geoFellows are closely trained by more senior Fellows, and participate in weekly read-outs with both internal and external (i.e., practitioner) stakeholders on relevant projects.  Further, geoFellows become elgiible for a unique slate of summer internship programs to continue their project work.</p>
