I"q<p>In this paper, we present a test of the use of transfer learning in convolutional neural networks in conjunction with high resolution satellite imagery of roads to determine (a) if road quality can be estimated with a reasonable degree of accuracy with satellite imagery, and (b) the degree to which such an approach can be applied across different geographies.</p>
