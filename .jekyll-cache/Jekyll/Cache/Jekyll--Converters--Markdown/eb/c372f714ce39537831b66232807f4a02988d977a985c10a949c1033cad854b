I"L<p>This paper presents a novel Toponym-based Approach to Automated Georeferencing (TAAG), using information about the names and locations of toponyms contained in most maps to determine the coordinates of the map contents. Through large-scale testing of computer simulated maps, we demonstrate that TAAG is capable of georeferencing a wide range of maps at accuracy levels similar to that of humans. Further, we explore possible sources of error when using the TAAG algorithm, providing guidance to practitioners or researchers that might seek to implement or extend the methodology.</p>
