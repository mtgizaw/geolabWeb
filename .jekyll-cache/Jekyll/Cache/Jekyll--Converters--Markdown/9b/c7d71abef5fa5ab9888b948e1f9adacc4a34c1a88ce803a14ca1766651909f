I"Y<p>The <em>C</em>limate <em>I</em>ntervention <em>E</em>ffectiveness <em>P</em>rogramme conducts analyses (and collects data) to help better inform global climate change mitigation efforts.  CIEP is predominantly focused on two types of activities:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Natural-experiment based analyses of the effectiveness of past mitigation efforts, frequently using satellite imagery to observe if a project achieved intended impacts, and</li>
  <li>Projects which seek to measure and map social vulnerability to the effects of a shifting climate.</li>
</ol>

<p>Within this framework, geoLab students and practitioners have partnered with a range of organizations (including the Global Environment Facility, FAO, IFAD, and a number of NGOs) to implement replicable and quantitative models which provide insights into ongoing climate mitigation efforts.</p>
