#Title of Linked Article
title: "Using Satellite Data and Deep Learning to Estimate Educational Outcomes in Data Sparse Environments."

#A very (very!) short excerpt of your article.  No more than one sentence, optimally less than 10 words.
excerpt: "In this article, we present a case study estimating school test scores based solely on publicly available imagery in both the Philippines (2010, 2014) and Brazil (2016). We contrast single image convolutional neural network (CNN) approaches to multi-source ensembles and find predictive accuracy for individual schools across years and regions ranging from 76% to 80%. Finally, we discuss broader considerations related to the operational use of CNN-based approaches for measuring socioeconomic factors, and provide open source computer code for community use."
