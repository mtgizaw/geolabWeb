title: "Predicting road quality using high resolution satellite imagery: A transfer learning approach"

#A very (very!) short excerpt of your article.  No more than one sentence, optimally less than 10 words.
excerpt: "In this paper, we present a test of the use of transfer learning in convolutional neural networks in conjunction with high resolution satellite imagery of roads to determine (a) if road quality can be estimated with a reasonable degree of accuracy with satellite imagery, and (b) the degree to which such an approach can be applied across different geographies."
