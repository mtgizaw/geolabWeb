The geoFellows program gives students the opportunity to receive monetary support for their leadership activities.  Generally as a team lead or in direct support of an externally-funded project, students get hands on experience working on some of the hardest problems we face today. Students have engaged in geoFellowships in a wide range of contexts - from leading student teams at William & Mary, to summer internships with the United Nations, Department of Defense, and Global Environment Facility.
