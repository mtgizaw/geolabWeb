The geoFellows program has three core goals, focused on increasing the diversity of leaders in the computational sciences:

1. Increase the number of minorities - especially females - engaged in computational research related topics.
2. Engage with students enrolled in fields of study that do not usually overlap with computational research - i.e., History, Art, or Dance.
3. Promote effective leadership in the context of real-world projects.

Each academic year, a competitively selected group of students from universities all across the Commonwealth of Virginia are selected to become a geoFellow, and individual Fellows are assigned into leadership roles within a project that matches their interests.  geoFellows are closely trained by more senior Fellows, and participate in weekly read-outs with both internal and external (i.e., practitioner) stakeholders on relevant projects.  Further, geoFellows become elgiible for a unique slate of summer internship programs to continue their project work.
