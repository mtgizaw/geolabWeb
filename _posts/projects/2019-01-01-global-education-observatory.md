The Global Education Observatory focuses on collecting, disseminating, and imputing information about school test scores in underserved environments.  Our staff and students submit hundreds of Freedom of Information Act requests to governments all around the world, standardize information we receive, and input that data into modeling efforts which leverage satellite data to impute school outcomes based on observable school infrastructure.
