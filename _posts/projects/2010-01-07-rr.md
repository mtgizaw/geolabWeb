Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been extensively used to assess road networks using both (a) imagery collected on the ground (i.e., using smartphone imagery), and (b) imagery collected by remote sensing platforms such as satellites or UAVs.  To date, apparent disciplinary barriers have resulted in fundamentally different questions being asked depending on the type of source data used in CNN analyses.  Imagery collected on the ground is largely used for road quality or as input into self-driving algorithms, whereas imagery collected by satellite or airborne systems is largely used to identify the growth or change in road networks in inaccessible areas (i.e., conflict zones).  This work proposes to bridge this gap, leveraging high resolution remotely sensed data to estimate infrastructure quality of road networks using satellite data.
