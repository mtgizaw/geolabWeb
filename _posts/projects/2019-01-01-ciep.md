The **C**limate **I**ntervention **E**ffectiveness **P**rogramme conducts analyses (and collects data) to help better inform global climate change mitigation efforts.  CIEP is predominantly focused on two types of activities: 

1. Natural-experiment based analyses of the effectiveness of past mitigation efforts, frequently using satellite imagery to observe if a project achieved intended impacts, and
2. Projects which seek to measure and map social vulnerability to the effects of a shifting climate.

Within this framework, geoLab students and practitioners have partnered with a range of organizations (including the Global Environment Facility, FAO, IFAD, and a number of NGOs) to implement replicable and quantitative models which provide insights into ongoing climate mitigation efforts.
