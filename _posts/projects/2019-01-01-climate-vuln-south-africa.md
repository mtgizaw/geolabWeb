Using census data from the 2011 South African census and precipitation data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA), a multicriteria index ranking the relative climate vulnerability to drought of areas in South Africa was created. The index was developed by aggregating social characteristics into a Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI) using a principle components analysis (PCA), and aggregating biophysical characteristics into a standardized precipitation index (SPI) representative of drought risk.
