Produced and maintained by the William & Mary [geoLab](http://geolab.wm.edu/) since 2017, the geoBoundaries Global Database of Political Administrative Boundaries Database is an online, open license resource of boundaries (i.e., state, county) for every country in the world. We currently track 199 total entities, including all 195 UN member states, Greenland, Taiwan, Niue, and Kosovo. All boundaries are available to view or download in common file formats, including shapefiles; the only requirement for use is [acknowledgement](https://www.geoboundaries.org/index.html#citation). The most up-to-date information about geoBoundaries can be found at www.geoboundaries.org.
