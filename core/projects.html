We take on a wide range of applied and basic research projects at the intersection between artificial intelligence, machine learning, and large-scale spatial data analysis.  Each of our projects focuses on one of three core areas:
</p>
<details>
<summary><b>Vibrancy & Diversity</b></summary>
<p>Projects in this area seek to <b>empower the disempowered</b> by <b>increasing the diversity</b> of those that can participate in data-driven decisionmaking.  We do this by <b>providing free access</b> to critical "building block" datasets and technologies, and <b>training the next generation of leaders</b> in the use of data for decisionmaking activities.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>Sustainability</b></summary>
<p>Projects in this area seek to <b>mitigate</b> negative human implications of a changing climate, focusing on the <b>identificaiton</b> of solutions that have worked - or, not - to date.  We do this by <b>developing new methodologies</b> which take advantage of freely available satellite imagery to monitor mitigation and adaptation strategies all across the globe.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>Security</b></summary>
<p>Projects in this area seek to <b>reduce</b> the likelihood that citizens of the United States and its allies are put in harms way. We do this by <b>collecting and publishing</b> event-based data on where country actors are conducting activities that may mediate security environments around the world, and <b>deriving new machine learning approaches</b> to detect shifts in sentiment or infrastructure of relevance to the global security environment.</p>
